# MassFileRenameTool
The purpose of this program is to be able to rename a bunch of files all at once. The project was made using c# and Visual Studio's Form builder.
Download the zip file and extract it to your Visual Studio Projects folder, then open the project and make any edits you want. 
Use the Wizard to create an independent Exe file for quick and easy use.
